# UAC-Exploit ( Win 10 / 11 )

The Windows operating system uses a built-in security mechanism that requires users to confirm elevated privileges in order to perform certain system-level tasks. This protection mechanism aims to prevent unauthorized access to the system and protect user data. However, some attackers can bypass this security mechanism and gain administrator access to the system without proper authentication. In this repository, I present an exploit method that bypasses the admin access confirmation requirement in Windows 10 and 11.
